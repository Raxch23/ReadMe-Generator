# ReadMe-generator

## Description 
A ReadME generator that can quickly create a professional README file for a 
new project.

## Overview
Challenge 11 in my Front-End Web Development bootcamp. In this task, I was able to demonstrate some fundamental Node.js ideas.


## Description

Writing Javascript utilising Node modules like File System and Inquirer was the task at hand. By responding to a series of questions, which are penned into a newly formed README.md file, the user can create a README file directly from the command prompt. This will allow them to concentrate on the project's highest priority tasks.
